The Movie Search App is a feature-rich web application created using React.js that allows users to search for movies and save their favorites for quick access. It connects to the OMDB (Open Movie Database) public API to retrieve detailed information about movies, including their titles, posters, release years, and other relevant details. The main goal of this application is to provide an interactive platform where users can conveniently look up movies and build a personalized list of favorites for future reference.

This project was developed using Visual Studio Code, a widely used and efficient code editor that supports modern JavaScript and React development. The editor's robust features, such as real-time syntax highlighting, auto-completion, integrated terminal, and version control, greatly streamlined the development process. Visual Studio Code also allowed easy management of the projectâ€™s folder structure, component files, and style sheets, making the overall experience organized and developer-friendly.

React.js served as the foundation of the app, providing a flexible and modular approach to building the user interface. With React, the app's UI components were designed to update dynamically based on the application's state and user interactions. The Create React App tool was used at the beginning to scaffold the project with all necessary configurations, reducing setup time and allowing immediate focus on functionality. Axios, a popular HTTP client for JavaScript, was used to make API calls to OMDB. This library made it simple to send requests, handle responses, and manage errors such as invalid search queries or missing data.

The application follows a clean component-based architecture. It includes separate components for the movie search input, the display of movie results, and the list of favorite movies. These components are placed within a dedicated components folder to maintain separation of concerns and enhance readability. Styling is handled using custom CSS files, which ensure that the app looks clean, modern, and responsive across different devices.

Users can search for movies by entering a keyword into the search bar. The app fetches matching results from the OMDB API and displays them as movie cards, each showing essential details such as the movie poster and title. Users can click to add any movie to their favorites, which are saved locally within the app. This favorite list is displayed in a separate section for easy access. The app also handles user input validation and displays messages when no results are found or an error occurs.

This Movie Search App can be used by film enthusiasts to keep track of movies they want to watch or have already watched. It also demonstrates how to integrate external APIs, manage local state, and build responsive and interactive web applications using modern front-end technologies. Educationally, the project provided hands-on experience with core React concepts like hooks, props, state management, conditional rendering, and component lifecycle.

Looking forward, the app can be expanded with more features such as saving favorites to a database, user authentication, filtering by genre or rating, and integrating reviews or trailers. Overall, the Movie Search App is a practical, user-friendly project that showcases how modern JavaScript tools can be used to create engaging, real-world applications.
